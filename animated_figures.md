#### Atmospheric composition trends for simulated planets around M stars after 5 Gyr. Colors are chosen arbitrarily and color intensity indicates species molar concentrations as a function of orbital period vs. planet radius (left) and atmospheric scale height (right). Each group corresponds to atmospheres with molar concentration $\geq 50\\%$, except H<sub>2</sub>O, for which the cutoff is 5\%. Red indicates O<sub>2</sub>, green indicates CO<sub>2</sub>, yellow indicates CO, blue indicates H<sub>2</sub>O, orange indicates He, and grey indicates H<sub>2</sub>. Planets trend toward greater oxidation with smaller radii and shorter orbital periods as a result of atmospheric escape-driven fractionation and magma ocean volatile exchange. H<sub>2</sub>O-rich planets are exceptional in that they are not well confined in period-raidus space and typically do not reach atmospheric molar concentrations above ~ 10\% as a result of our dry start assumption.
