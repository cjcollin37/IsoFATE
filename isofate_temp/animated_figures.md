# Cherubim et al. 2025 animated figures

##### All figures shown here were generated from data discussed in Cherubim et al. 2025. The plotted data come from Monte Carlo simulations using a coupled atmospheric escape-magma ocean/equilibrium chemistry model (IsoFATE+Atmodeller). The selected figures correspond to energy-limited EUV-driven/radiative recombination-limited photoevaporation of planets around an early M type star.

## Figure 1

#### Atmospheric composition trends for simulated planets around M stars over time. Colors are chosen arbitrarily and color intensity indicates species molar concentrations as a function of orbital period vs. planet radius (left) and atmospheric scale height (right). Each group corresponds to atmospheres with molar concentration $\geq 50\\%$, except H<sub>2</sub>O, for which the cutoff is 5\%. Red indicates O<sub>2</sub>, green indicates CO<sub>2</sub>, yellow indicates CO, blue indicates H<sub>2</sub>O, orange indicates He, and grey indicates H<sub>2</sub>. Planets trend toward greater oxidation with smaller radii and shorter orbital periods as a result of atmospheric escape-driven fractionation and magma ocean volatile exchange. H<sub>2</sub>O-rich planets are exceptional in that they are not well confined in period-raidus space and typically do not reach atmospheric molar concentrations above ~ 10\% as a result of our dry start assumption.

#### Atmospheric composition trends for simulated planets around M stars over time. x<sub>i</sub> indicates the molar concentration of a given species at each point in time. Brown circles indidate planets that have completely lost their atmospheres. Squares indicate planets that have elevated D/H ratios greater than 10 x protosolar D/H (Lodders et al. 2003). Marker size corresponds to the indicated planet mass bins. Some planets show marginal increases in radius after several Gyr as a result of late-stage volatile outgassing from the solidifying magma ocean. Most planets have non-zero mantle melt fractions by 5 Gyr.

## Supplemental Figure 1

#### Atmospheric composition trends for simulated planets around M stars over time. Percentages reflect fractions of all simulated planets with the corresponding dominant atmospheric species. Planets with atmospheres dominated by molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub> worlds) are the most common type of non-H<sub>2</sub> planet, i.e. planets with secondary atmospheres that are largely sculpted by escape and interior exchange. This prediction is robust to many assumptions discussed in Cherubim et al. 2025. 

## Supplemental Figure 2

#### Same as Supplemental Figure 1, but only planets with non-H<sub>2</sub> atmospheres are considered, i.e. planets with secondary atmospheres that are largely sculpted by escape and interior exchange.
